# Weather App - Comtrade Project
This app gets up-to-date and accurate weather forecast information available for the next four days.

This app has been developed to practice my skills with Java Script, HTML and CSS. This project shows you how to:

* use the [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org) API to get weather forecast for 4 days.
* use [Leaflet-map](https://leafletjs.com/) to make map of the city on web app.
* use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling.
* use [ES6](http://es6-features.org/#Constants) for latest recommended standards.
